Fire Damages Pet Food Warehouse
Rochester: April 1st. late in the evening of March 29th, a fire caused extensive damage to the Huggy Dog Co. pet food warehouse on West 24th Street. There were no injuries. The only employee on the premises was security guard Russ Looupinek, who called in the fire at 9:47 p.m.  Fire fighters arrived minutes later and put out the blaze. Most of the loading area was destroyed. The cost of the damage is estimated at $400.000.
Early investigations point to a faulty heating system as the cause of the fire. According to a Huggy Dog spokesperson, the company that installed the system, AMC Heaters, had ignored numerous complaints about the heating units over the past 4 weeks. Huggy Dog plans to take legal action against ANC Heaters.\
