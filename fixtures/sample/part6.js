Mrs. Marion Edwards,
56 Standsfield Street
Manchester
{{index}} ____ Mrs. Edwards,
Thank you for your letter regarding one of our recent programs. You wrote to complain about the use of language in the drama Life on the Edge.\
You felt that the language was inappropriate ___ television. I understand your concern, but would like to explain your reasons for including curse words. Life on the Edge does have a large number of curse words, but as it was shown after 10 p.m, we felt that it was ___ for a night time audience. Of course, we would never allow bad language to be included in anything shown before 9 p.m. I hope that this incident has not spoiled your enjoyment of ITB programming, and that you ___ to watch our shows.
Sincerely,
Michael A. Jameson
